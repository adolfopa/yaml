;; A simple key is a key that is not denoted by the '?' indicator.

;;   ---
;;   block simple key: value
;;   ? not a simple key:
;;   { flow simple key: value }
;; We emit the KEY token before all keys, so when we find a potential
;; simple key, we try to locate the corresponding ':' indicator.
;; Simple keys should be limited to a single line and 1024 characters.
  
;; Can a simple key start at the current position? A simple key may
;; start:
;; - at the beginning of the line, not counting indentation spaces
;;       (in block context),
;; - after '{', '[', ',' (in the flow context),
;; - after '?', ':', '-' (in the block context).
;; In the block context, this flag also signifies if a block
;; collection may start at the current position.

;; is `flow_level'; there can be no more than one possible simple key
;; for each level. The value is a SIMPLE-KEY record:
